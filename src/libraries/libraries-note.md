## Custom Libraries

The following libraries are custom to ehRadio, mostly inherited from yoRadio v0.9.533.  They cannot be easily replaced with an external library.

### Trip5's Thoughts

It seems to me most of this codebase was actually developed for Arduino IDE by hand and if it compiled, it was left alone until functionality was broke and it had to be fixed.

This file was my own hand-made hand-googled investigation of the source of the libraries.
Actually there used to be dozens of libraries just for displays but they were literally copies of libraries available on Platformio.
Some libraries like encoder and onebutton were outdated and benefitted from using online libraries.

But the audio decoding libraries are troublesome. They are extremely modified from whatever their original source was.
I have to assume most of it was cribbed from edzelf's code by e2002 in the early days of yoRadio, and as long as it worked, it wasn't updated.
See more about this below.

I don't like the idea of using a bunch of custom libraries... But...
I did a deep investigation into ILI9486/8 library to see if I could use another library and... it's irreplaceable.
Most of the libraries that remain here probably are - if simply because they are not available as libraries on platformio.

If you have trouble with one of these custom libraries or an online library...
Sorry and good luck.

### Display Drivers

#### Adafruit GC9106
  - https://github.com/prenticedavid/Adafruit_GC9102_kbv
  - not on Platformio (and not actually an Adafruit library)

#### Adafruit ST7796S
  - https://github.com/prenticedavid/Adafruit_ST7796S_kbv
  - not on Platformio (and not actually an Adafruit library)

#### Adafruit ILI9225 
  - from ёRadio v0.9.710, likely original or cribbed from other Adafruit drivers (like above)
  - Replaced ILI9225Fix (which required a lot of `#if DSP_MODEL==DSP_ILI9225` (or `!=`) fixes in the codebase)
    - original likely modified from https://github.com/arduinopavlodar/TFT_22_ILI9225
    - those fixes have been removed
  
#### FT6336_Touchscreen
  - made by https://github.com/kasperaitis for ehRadio
  - used as source: https://github.com/aselectroworks/Arduino-FT6336U

#### ILI9488
  - highly-modified from version 1.0.5 https://github.com/ZinggJM/ILI9486_SPI
  - possibly irreplaceable due to how it manipulates ILI9486/8 quirks
    - seriously, after some deep investigation, I'm impressed this display works as well as it does compared to other libraries

#### LiquidCrystalI2C
  - slightly-modified from version 1.1.3 https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C

#### SSD1322
  - slightly-modified from initial commit https://github.com/JamesHagerman/Jamis_SSD1322

#### ST7920
  - very similar or modified (or perhaps share a common source) with https://github.com/BornaBiro/ST7920_GFX_Library
  - may be worth looking at as well: https://github.com/BornaBiro/ST7920_GFX_Library


### Audio Decoder Drivers

#### ES8311_Audio
  - made by https://github.com/kasperaitis for ehRadio

#### I2S_Audio
  - likely adapted from https://github.com/schreibfaul1/ESP32-audioI2S (a long time ago)
  - ehRadio uses libraries adapted from Maleksm's yoRadio mod https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=1010378&st=11240#entry125839228
  - first used v0.9.434m(04.04.25)
  - attempt to update using Maleksm's mod v0.9.533m failed at first...
  - ehRadio 2026.06.28 adapts Maleksm v0.9.720m(23.06.26)

#### VS1053_Audio
  - original DNA in https://github.com/Edzelf/Esp-radio and https://github.com/Edzelf/ESP32Radio-V2
  - but then replaced with https://github.com/schreibfaul1/ESP32-vs1053_ext
  - ehRadio at first adapted Maleksm's yoRadio mod v0.9.434m(04.04.25): https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=1010378&st=11240#entry125839228
  - attempts to update using Maleksm's mod v0.9.533m failed
  - ehRadio 2026.06.28 adapts nsteplanet's PR to yoRadio November 28, 2025: https://github.com/e2002/yoradio/pull/226
